This modification updates and completes the linked cloud geometry dataset of the 3-D stereographic cloud reconstruction from specMACS measurements.
The new dataset includes the stereographically derived cloud geometry for all flight legs flown with HALO during the EUREC4A campaign except those where no points could be found, i.e. due to darkness.
Moreover, the previously existing "experimental" dataset has been removed.
